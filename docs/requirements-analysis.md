# Production Requirements Analysis

This document provides detailed analysis of each package in `requirements.txt`, explaining what it does and why it was chosen over alternatives.

## Core Web Framework

### FastAPI (>=0.104.0)
**What it does:** Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

- **vs MySQLdb (mysqlclient):** PyMySQL doesn't require compilation and works better in containerized environments.
- **vs aiomysql:** PyMySQL is synchronous and works well with SQLAlchemy's connection pooling.

**Key benefits:**
- Pure Python implementation (no compilation required)
- Easy installation via pip
- Compatible with MySQLdb API
- Works well in Docker containers
- Good performance for most use cases

## Data Visualization

### Plotly (>=5.17.0)
**What it does:** Interactive plotting library for creating web-based visualizations.

- Interactive charts (zoom, pan, hover)
- Web-native (works in browsers)
- Extensive chart types
- Easy integration with web applications
- Good performance for large datasets

## Numerical Computing

### NumPy (>=1.24.0)
**What it does:** Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing N-dimensional array objects.

**Why chosen over alternatives:**
- **vs Pandas:** NumPy is lower-level and more efficient for numerical operations, while Pandas is higher-level for data analysis.
- **vs SciPy:** NumPy provides the core array functionality that SciPy builds upon.
- **vs PyTorch/TensorFlow:** NumPy is lighter weight for basic numerical operations without ML overhead.

**Key benefits:**
- Fast array operations
- Foundation for many other scientific libraries
- Memory efficient
- Extensive mathematical functions
- Industry standard for numerical computing

## Environment Management

### python-dotenv (>=1.0.0)
**What it does:** Loads environment variables from a .env file into os.environ.

**Why chosen over alternatives:**
- **vs os.environ directly:** python-dotenv provides a clean way to manage environment variables in development.
- **vs python-decouple:** python-dotenv is more widely adopted and has better documentation.
- **vs configparser:** python-dotenv is simpler for environment variable management.

**Key benefits:**
- Simple .env file support
- No external dependencies
- Works well with Docker and cloud deployments
- Industry standard for Python projects

## Data Validation

### Pydantic (>=2.0.0)
**What it does:** Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
